### Calculator (2025)

This simple calculator is designed to provide basic functions along with a few useful advanced features. It includes standard operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Also, it includes a backspace button to correct mistakes by removing the last entered digit. The square root button allows users to quickly find the square root of a number, while the percentage button makes it easy to calculate percentages. A dedicated pi button makes it ideal for users working with geometry or trigonometry. The interface is intuitive, ensuring that both basic and more complex calculations are quick and effortless.
